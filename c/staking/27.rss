          <title>Staatenlos Node Joins Alliance to Improve Service To Radix Delegators</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[kesswi | radixdltstaking.com]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Staking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Once again RadixDLT Staking and Radical Staking have great news for the Radix community:</p>
<p>Staatenlos Node has joined our alliance to maximize 100% uptime and rewards for our delegators and now all three of us will support each other’s validator nodes in the very unlikely event of unprecedented situations where one of our nodes goes down and our respective teams are not able to bring it back up.</p>
<p>This will provide yet another layer of security, reliability and resiliency on top of the existing measures that we already have in place for our productive nodes individually, such as multiple fully-synced server backups, multiple database backups, and team members that help provide 24x7x365 on-call support for node issues. With the added expertise and experience of the Staatenlos team-who are the co-founders of Ociswap, there are three Node Runner now supporting each other in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>All delegators of RadixDLT Staking, RadicalStaking and Staatenlos Node can rest easy, knowing that their delegated XRD is in good hands.</p>
<p>Find out more about Staatenlos Node, check out their <a href="https://staatenlos.ch/staatenlos/radix-staatenlos-node/">website</a> and <a href="https://t.me/radix_staatenlos">Telegram</a>, which supports both German and English speakers.</p>
<p>As always, we recommend spreading your XRD stakes across multiple delegators, including validator nodes in the bottom 50% to promote the security and decentralisation of the Radix network.</p>

            <p>Viskosity have announced today that they have taken the decision to unregister their node on 17th February 2022 and have requested all stakers to remove their stake.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Radix Community,<br>
The time has come where our node on the network is no longer helping the RadixDLT achieve its goals. PLEASE REMOVE ALL STAKED ALLOCATIONS TO VISCOSITY NODE IMMEDIATELY. We will be unregistering tomorrow. The 10,000 XRD for compensation of our downtime will be distributed on 2/16/22 as well. After internal discussions we have decided this is the best course of action for the overall success of RadixDLT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this is an opportunity for stakers to redistribute stake to nodes who have less than 2% stake and improve decentralisation.  Please remember to stake responsibly: <a href="https://radixtalk.com/t/how-do-i-choose-which-validators-to-delegate-stake-to/140">Choosing Validators</a></p>

          <title>Radical Staking and RadixDLT Staking are expanding their Partnership</title>

          <category>Staking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Radical Staking and RadixDLT Staking have great news for the Radix community:</p>
<p>We’ve expanded our partnership to support each other’s validator nodes in the very unlikely event of unprecedented situations where one of our nodes goes down and our respective teams are not able to bring it back up.</p>
<p>This will provide an additional layer of security and reliability on top of the existing measures that we already have in place for our productive nodes, such as multiple fully-synced backup servers, multiple database backups, and team members that help provide 24x7x365 on-call support for node issues. This additional layer of security and reliability will provide coverage against catastrophic events that are very unlikely but possible, such as environmental disasters that may cause extended power outages over large geographic areas, or global service outages from multiple cloud providers. We operate in different geographic areas already covering both the U.S. and Europe, and we use different infrastructure and cloud providers, which allows us to complement each other’s validator capabilities in a perfect way.</p>
<p>Radical Staking and RadixDLT Staking have had a close working relationship since Olympia Mainnet went live, in which we collaborate to perform joint troubleshooting of validator node issues and develop best practices to reduce missed proposals and improve node stability. We then share our findings in the Node-Runners channel in Discord and other places such as our GitHub sites to contribute to the continuous improvement of overall network health.</p>
<p>We have abided by the Validator Code of Conduct (<a href="https://radixtalk.com/badges/109/validator-code-of-conduct">https://radixtalk.com/badges/109/validator-code-of-conduct</a>) and we actively follow its recommendations.</p>
<p>We are driven to operate our nodes with maximum uptime and hence, maximizing our delegator’s rewards, and also securing the Radix network as a whole.</p>
<p>As you evaluate different validator nodes, please consider including our nodes in your delegations. As always, we recommend spreading your XRD stakes across multiple delegators, including validator nodes in the bottom 50% to promote the security and decentralisation of the Radix network.</p>

<p><strong>About Me/Us</strong><br>
I’m Trond from Norway, a working family guy interested in tech in general. I’ve always had a broad interest in technology and have robust little network of servers running in the basement as an example of how nerdy i am. Just so you know how old i am, in my childhood i had fun with gaming and programming on the C64, Amiga, and on PC’s with BBS’s with modems before the internet/http came out. I think that says alot! <img src="https://cdn.radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
Been following crypto for years, but with covid i had spare time so i got involved in crypto in 2020 with mining. This expanded and today i have several rigs and run some nodes as well as a hobby/investment.<br>
I came across Radix late last year while looking for a superior technical blockchain which solves the trilemma and immediately saw it’s huge potential. I’m therefore commited to supporting the Radix<br>
project and to see it grow into that potential with you all. I’m pressed for time between work and family, but asides from the nodes i’m also working on a simple NFT marketplace these days which i think is a fun project.<br>
I also have a friend/colleague that helps out with monitoring and acting on alarms if i am unavailable as a last resort, but most of the node work is done by me. I’m considering getting some more help if it’s not enough.</p>
<p><strong>Validator Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>The infrastructure is decentralised and avoiding big cloud providers i something that is a main criteria in our setup. This is in case AWS or others have a centralised problem and 30% of the blockchain suffers with it.<br>
Therefore i run three nodes currently. One is located in Norway, Sandefjord at Terrahost. The other is located in Sweden with Inleed. The tertiary node is in my basement. Nodes are monitored with Grafana, Pagerduty and Uptimerobot.<br>
Snapshots are taken as well in case of corruption and fast restore is needed/possible. Changes are tested on stokenet (hosted on contabo) before anything is done in production. Failover can be done with premade scripts globally reachable via our phones with termius/VPN.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong><br>
I work as a network/IT architect and i’ve been in the business for 25+ years working as a consultant, for different companies and ISPs. Has set up alot servers in different shapes and sizes, late years it’s more linux, containers and clouds.<br>
At work we do some Terraform/Ansible for automation, i also do some setups in AWS cloud. I’m not a strong coder, have done some java/python before, but mainly focus on running the nodes smooth with tools that are generally available and try to keep things simple and tested so they function when they are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Why should delegators stake to your validator?</strong><br>
Well it’s simple really. I’m dedicated to securing yours and my stake, and everyone else really too. I even got my family invested in Radix because i believe in it, so we need to make it the best crypto out there! I’m also a responsible person so when i set out on doing something it’s all in and doing it properly or not at all.<br>
I’m just about always online and reachable, and the phone is set to getting messages and alerts in different channels. So therefore i/we will react if something crucial happens fast.</p>
<p>Other things about us is that Norway has green hydropower energy, because we have alot of mountains and waterfalls. We are also an ociswap validator partner, so you get 10% extra $OCI when you stake with us. We are also running $VKC giveaways to new stakers now and in the future. $VKC or vikingcoin as the name is, is a token created for usage in future ecosystem dapps. So now as a start it’s usable as payment on our sistersite <a href="http://www.vikingplanet.net" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.vikingplanet.net</a> (simple NFT marketplace).<br>
We are also doing NFT giveaways now and in the future. Lastly we as a node are truly in the bottom of the 100, so we really need your stake to stay there or even climb a bit. Also staking with the bottom 50 helps desentralise the stake, so not the top nodes and downtime on them can affect the entire network.</p>
<p>So hopefully you will consider a portion of your stake with us, we would really appreciate it!<br>
If you have any questions or anything else you are wondering about that i failed to mention, feel free to contact me.</p>

<p><strong>About Me/Us</strong><br>
I have been working in infrastructure technologies within the banking and finance industry for over 20 years now. At the start of the pandemic I was forced into bit of a career break which gave me the opportunity to spend more time researching into Proof of Stake projects and looking at where I could apply my skills whilst also being part of the evolution of the industry. At the tail end of 2020 I made the decision to start running nodes and setup Avaunt Staking Services where we run nodes on a number of POS and DPOS networks including Radix and Avalanche.<br>
I also recently become an official Radvocate, providing support to the community across the many Radix related social channels.</p>
<p><strong>Validator Infrastructure</strong><br>
We currently run two nodes (primary &amp; backup) across two separate AWS London Availability Zones. We have decided on AWS as they provide a consistently high SLA and uptime and although they are more expensive than other Cloud providers we have never had an outage or downtime since we first started using them in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong><br>
Avaunt Staking has been running a Radix node since the start of Betanet and have been an active member across all the social channels, providing support to new node runners and delegators alike. We created the popular and free community dashboard <a href="https://radixdashboard.com">https://radixdashboard.com</a>. We have been running Validator nodes on other dPOS and standard POS networks for the past 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>Why should delegators stake to your validator?</strong><br>
I absolutely love Crypto and Technology innovation and when the opportunity arose to run a validator node on the future of de-fi I immediately jumped at the chance to support the network. I also love learning and have spent many hours reading blogs and watching videos on node running and the different architectures. The pace of innovation is just mind blowing and I absolutely love being a part of it.<br>
I think all the Radix Validator community are an awesome bunch of people and they never cease to amaze me with the support they give to other validators and delegators for the greater good of the network. I think what sets Avaunt apart however is that we provide value added services like our community dashboard <a href="http://radixdashboard.com">radixdashboard.com</a> and initiating community events like the Know your Node Runner AMA sessions.</p>

<p><strong>About Me/Us</strong><br>
<em>The team at Logical Moon are composed of two friends who are based out of Brisbane, Australia. We have been involved in the cryptocurrency scene since 2016 and have followed the Radix Project since December 2017. We both have extensive experience in delivering/maintaining enterprise grade solutions across a variety of industries and have a genuine passion for technology</em></p>
<p><strong>Validator Infrastructure</strong><br>
<em>The validator node itself was brought to life in September 2021 and we were able to quickly establish ourselves into the top 100 having been involved in an early investment group for Radix. It currently runs on Azure in the Australia South East Region and we have a backup node constantly running in the Australia East region to ensure high availability. We provide 24/7 support and leverage Azure’s alerting capabilities to escalate any issues to our team. We constantly push to ensure the server is performant/secured and review/update our infrastructure regularly</em></p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong><br>
<em>Katan is a Solution Architect and Developer with 20 years of industry experience and his colleague Rory is adept in building cloud based applications and currently helps build and manage a number of applications for an international legal software application firm</em></p>
<p><strong>Why should delegators stake to your validator?</strong><br>
<em>We care about the network, the community and ultimately the Radix project as a whole. To achieve a truly decentralised network, it is important to ensure there are enough nodes globally available and with a spread of stake distributed adequately amongst them.  We’ve been initially focused on ensuring we have a stable setup, but as we seem to have found our sweet spot, you’ll see us more actively share content built to help support the radix network</em></p>

            <p>You will notice in the Radix explorer validator list (and other community sites) that as well as the validator fee and uptime, the “Owner Stake” is also provided.</p>
<p>The owner stake is the amount of XRD that the validator owner has delegated to their own node and is a measure of how much “skin in the game” they have.</p>
<p>In the future when slashing is implemented (see here: <a href="https://radixtalk.com/t/does-radix-implement-slashing/175">Slashing</a>) the owner stake will help to signify how much personal stake the validator is risking and can be used as a way of determining whether or not they are likely to engage in any malicious behaviour.</p>
<p>However, some validators elect not to use the owner wallet for their personal staking and choose to stake from an alternative wallet.  This could be for a number of honest reasons, such as wanting to separate their income between fees and staking and is not necessarily a cause for concern.  In this case, it is advisable to contact the validator to understand their reasoning.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Whenever a delegator unstakes from a validator there is a 500 epoch (~12-14 days) delay before the staked tokens are available to be used.  This delay is designed to allow adequate time for any malicious behaviour by a validator to be detected and punished accordingly.</p>
<p>In future, slashing will be implemented that will penalise validators (and their stakers to some extent) in the event of malicious behaviour (such as a double spend).  The details of how slashing will be implemented is not yet known.  See also this topic for further details on slashing:</p>

            <p>Not currently - there is however currently a 500 epoch (~12 days) delay to unstake.  Should a validator act maliciously, this would limit the time available to profit from any double spend or similar attack, and also allow adequate time for confident slashing in future.</p>
<p>The Radix team have clearly communicated their intention to introduce slashing after mainnet release, but we are yet to learn when this will be implemented and the precise details.  You can see Matt’s (Radix CPO) response regarding slashing in the official Discord server here:</p>

          <title>Do I have to trust the Validator node I am staking to?</title>

          <category>Staking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There is a degree of trust required in your chosen validator(s).  As stakers, we are delegating our stake to these validators to act in the best interests of the network, in exchange for emission rewards.</p>
<p>However currently (at the time of writing) slashing has not yet been implemented on Radix, which is the mechanism in which validators (and stakers to a degree) are penalised if a validator acts maliciously (such as attempting a double spend).  You can find out more about slashing here: <a href="https://radixtalk.com/t/does-radix-implement-slashing/175">Slashing</a></p>
<p>Aside from malicious validator activity (which is really the worst case scenario and hopefully a very rare occurence!) there are other ways in which we may need to trust validators.</p>
<p>For example, we need to trust our validators to operate in not only the network’s best interests, but also our own.  This means operating reliable nodes with consistently high uptime.</p>
<p>Every validator will experience downtime at some point, due to unplanned maintenance, attacks etc… but the important thing to remember in these cases, is that your staked XRD never actually leave your wallet.  In the event that a validator did go offline (or even disappear altogether) there is no risk of funds being lost.  You would simply need to unstake, and after the <a href="https://radixtalk.com/t/how-long-does-it-take-to-unstake-xrd-from-a-validator/97">Unstaking Delay</a> would have full access to your XRD once again.</p>

          <title>What impact do Validator fees have on my staking rewards?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Faraz | Radstakes.com]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Staking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Validators specify a fee for providing their services to delegators.  Fees vary from 0% to 5%+ and will affect the rewards received.  Here’s a couple of examples to explain the impact of validator fees on staking rewards:</p>
<p>Let’s assume you are staking on 3 validators, we’ll call them Validator A, B and C (not very creative I know!)</p>
<p>Let’s also assume that the APY for staking is 10% and you are staking 10,000XRD with each validator.</p>
<p>Validator A has specified a fee of 0%<br>
Validator B has specified a fee of 1%<br>
Validator C has specified a fee of 3%</p>
<p>With Validator A, you can expect to receive 1000XRD in year 1 (1000 - 0% = 10% APY)<br>
With Validator B, you can expect to receive 990XRD in year 1 (1000 - 1% = 9.9% APY)<br>
With Validator C, you can expect to receive 970XRD in year 1 (1000 - 3% = 9.7% APY)</p>
<p>As you can see, the fees are calculated based on the rewards received and not the APY.  The impact of fees on staking rewards are therefore quite insignificant compared to uptime for example, which will have a much greater effect on rewards received.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>If a validator you’re delegated to drops out of the Top 100, it automatically gets removed from the <em>validator set.</em><br>
This means that the validator node <strong>won’t be making proposals and thus won’t earn any staking rewards</strong>, until it reaches back into the Top 100.</p>
<p>It is advised in those cases to either contact the node runner (to see if he/she has any plans to push the validator back into the top 100) or to request an unstake and join another validator in the top 100.<br>
Keep in mind that unstaking <em>always</em> takes 500 epochs (read more about why <a href="https://radixtalk.com/t/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-unstake-from-a-validator/176">here.</a>)</p>

          <title>Can Validators increase their fees?</title>

          <category>Staking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yes, Validators can increase and decrease their fees at any time, subject to the rules below:</p>
<h3>
<a name="fee-increases-1" class="anchor" href="https://radixtalk.com#fee-increases-1"></a>Fee Increases</h3>
<ul>
<li>A 500 epoch delay occurs before the fee increase is applied</li>
<li>Fees may only increase by a maximum absolute increase of 10% at a time (e.g. from 0% to 10%, or 2% to 12%). If a validator wants to increase their fees by more than 10% then they will need to apply the changes over multiple 500 epoch delays.</li>
<li>The new, higher fee, will be displayed immediately in the Radix Explorer so that existing and potential stakers can see what the new fee will be.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<a name="fee-decreases-2" class="anchor" href="https://radixtalk.com#fee-decreases-2"></a>Fee Decreases</h3>
<ul>
<li>A fee decrease will take effect at the start of the next epoch</li>
<li>There is no limit to the decrease (e.g. from 20% to 0%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About Me/Us</strong><br>
Hello! My name is <em>Mattia</em> and I’m a 23 years old Telecommunications Engineering <img src="https://cdn.radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/satellite.png?v=12" title=":satellite:" class="emoji" alt=":satellite:"> student.<br>
I’ve been following Radix since 2013 when it was still called eMunie. I decided to run my own validator to have an active part in the community and to promote decentralization.</p>
<p>I also wrote my own mini “wiki” to help newcomers with easy to follow how-to guides for staking and much more. You can find me on Radix’s Discord or Telegram channel, I often post there!</p>
<p><strong>Validator Infrastructure</strong><br>
MattiaNode is running on a beefy self-hosted server in Italy, with an <strong>AMD Ryzen, 48GB of DDR4 3600MHz RAM, 1TB of NVMe SSD storage (WD SN750) and 1Gbit/s fiber connection</strong>, all backed up with an UPS that can keep everything running at least for an hour and a 4G LTE redundant internet connection.</p>
<p>We also have a <strong>backup node</strong> running in Finland with the <strong>same CPU, 64GB of DDR4 RAM,  1TB of NVMe SSD storage and 1Gbit/s fiber connection</strong>, always synched and ready to failover.</p>
<p>Everything is monitored with Grafana and multiple alerts are setup with UptimeRobot <img src="https://cdn.radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/robot.png?v=12" title=":robot:" class="emoji" alt=":robot:">, PagerDuty and more.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong><br>
I’ve been running servers in my homelab for quite some years now; I started small, with just some SBC (single-board computer), and now I have multiple VMs and LXC containers running across all my servers.<br>
My experience with crypto goes way back though: I got into crypto around 2012, when Bitcointalk was the core of all cryptocurrencies. I mined Bitcoins and Ethereum using my own gaming PC and had lots of fun learning all kinds of new things.<br>
I’ve been following Radix’s development since 2013 and also participated in eMunie’s beta-testing.</p>
<p><strong>Why should delegators stake to your validator?</strong><br>
I’m pretty sure that I’m the only validator node running on a self hosted server, right here where I live!<br>
By delegating your stake to my validator you’re promoting <em><strong>geographical decentralization</strong></em> and <em><strong>provider decentralization</strong></em>: there aren’t a lot of nodes running in Italy and none that are running on my ISP.<br>
Most are hosted on Amazon’s AWS, Google Cloud, Azure or Hetzner, while my node is independent from all those companies.<br>
If all those companies were to go down, most validators would be offline but mine would be still alive and kicking <img src="https://cdn.radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes.png?v=12" title=":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"></p>
<p>I’m also very dedicated to running a node since it fits two of my hobbies: cryptocurrencies and managing servers <img src="https://cdn.radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=12" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
<p>I successfully completed <strong>KYC with Radix Foundation</strong> and I am active in both Discord and Telegram groups, helping everyone that needs it and maybe even writing an article just to help them on my wiki.</p>
<p>All my XRD are staked at my own node, so you can bet that I monitor it closely <img src="https://cdn.radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Oh and I’m an <strong>OciSwap partner</strong>! You get 10% more OCI if you stake at my node. Meow <img src="https://cdn.radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes_cat.png?v=12" title=":heart_eyes_cat:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes_cat:"></p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!</p>

          <title>How do I choose which Validators to delegate stake to?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Faraz | Radstakes.com]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Staking</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There are a number of considerations to make when selecting validators.  Prior to Xi’an release in 2023 when Radix will be fully sharded, there are 100 validators who take part in consensus and earn emissions, so we must choose carefully between these validators to delegate our stake.  Here’s a guide for some of the considerations to make when selecting validators:</p>
<p><strong>How many?</strong><br>
It is advisable to delegate your stake to a number of different validators.  This reduces your risk of missed rewards in the event of a validator going offline or suffering some downtime.  A general rule of thumb is to select 5 validators.  There are however no limits, so you may choose to stake with more or less.</p>
<p><strong>Decentralisation</strong><br>
In the interest of ensuring that the network is truly decentralised, it is preferable for no single validator to have too much of the total stake.  In an ideal world, the top 100 validators would each have 1% of the total stake, so validators who are already above 2% total stake should be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
Similarly to the decentralisation argument above, if one or only a small number of nodes have a considerable amount of stake, this can put the security of the network at risk - for example a malicious actor only would only have to attack a smaller subset of nodes to cause disruption.  As above, it is advisable to stake on nodes with less than 2% stake.</p>
<p><strong>Fees</strong><br>
Validator fees are automatically deducted by the protocol and range from 0% - 3% typically.  Many validators operate nodes with 0% fees, however it should be considered that in order to operate robust infrastructure with backup nodes, monitoring systems and DDoS protection requires a significant financial outlay and it therefore may be a false economy to stake only to 0% fee validators.  Many validators will also not be able to sustain 0% fees indefinitely so the best advice is to contact them to understand what their longer term fee strategy is. (remember it takes ~2 weeks to unstake, so any benefit of 0% fees now could soon be lost if a validator then increases fees to 5% and you need to unstake).  Fees also have much less impact on your staking rewards than uptime (see thread <a href="https://radixtalk.com/t/what-impact-do-validator-fees-have-on-my-staking-rewards/168">here</a>).  A general rule of thumb is fees up to around 3% are considered fair.</p>
<p><strong>Uptime</strong><br>
Each validator is required to take part in consensus rounds in order to earn emissions.  The number of consensus proposals made are counted along with any proposals that are missed to determine the validator’s uptime.  If a validator’s uptime drops to less than 98% in any single epoch, no emissions are earned for that epoch.  It is therefore recommended to keep an eye on the uptime metric which is recorded on the official <a href="https://explorer.radixdlt.com/#/validators">Radix Explorer</a>, or on community tools such as <a href="https://www.radixscan.io/ValidatorTable.shtml">Radixscan</a> and <a href="https://www.radixdashboard.com/">Radix Dashboard</a>.  This uptime metric is measured over the last 150 epochs (~4 days) and should be 99.9%+ to ensure consistent high performance.</p>
<p><strong>Geography/Server Provider</strong><br>
Validators are spread throughout the world, the locations of which can be found using <a href="https://www.radix.earth/">Radix.earth</a> for example. In the interests of decentralisation, it is advisable to choose validators from under-represented geographies.  Furthermore, many validators use cloud providers to host their servers.  It is therefore advisable to consider avoiding the big providers such as Google, AWS, Azure in favour of smaller data centres.  Otherwise an outage at any one data centre could be very detrimental to the performance and security of the network.</p>

<p><strong>About Me/Us</strong><br>
Hi, I’m Faraz - owner of the Radstakes validator on Radix.  We were originally selected by the Radix team to run a node during Betanet and Stokenet testing, and have since continued to operate a node in the top 100 since the inception of the Radix mainnet and hope to continue to do so for a very long time to come!</p>
<p>In addition to operating a validator node, I also assist with the onboarding of newcomers to Radix by assisting other node runners and answering general queries in the official Radix social channels and now here in Radix Talk, so if you have any questions about Radix, please don’t hesitate to ask!</p>
<p><strong>Validator Infrastructure</strong><br>
Our primary validator node is hosted in Sweden, with a backup full node hosted in Germany in a separate data centre.  We pledge to only use dedicated hardware to ensure we never share our resources with others, with a minimum of 8 core CPU, 64GB of RAM and 2TB of NVMe SSD storage to future proof our operations and provide consistently high performance to our stakers.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong><br>
After first diving into the Crypto rabbit hole in 2014, we have mined both Bitcoin and Ethereum previously, using our own hardware and hosted infrastructure.  Since discovering Radix in 2017, we have been avid believers in the promise of this tech to disrupt the crypto industry and lead the DeFi revolution.</p>
<p><strong>Why should delegators stake to your validator?</strong><br>
We pride ourselves on transparency and trust, so always maintain an active presence in all social channels, and have completed KYC with the Radix foundation.  With our commitment on fixed fees, reliable infrastructure and honest communication, we aim to provide reassurance to the entire community that they can depend on us.</p>

<p><strong>About Me/Us</strong><br>
Hi, I’m Stuart from RadixPool. We run professionally managed Radix Validators under our own name and for other clients.</p>
<p>Although RadixPool is a relative newcomer to the Radix Community, we were fortunate to be selected to take part in the Radix Betanet and subsequent Stokenet Test network. We have tried to make a small contribution back to the community by creating documentation, scripts, performance optimisations and providing support in the Discord channels.</p>
<p><strong>Validator Infrastructure</strong><br>
RadixPool is running 8 servers supporting the Radix Mainnet distributed over 3 countries - Germany, United Kingdom and The Netherlands. Each Radix Node is running on dedicated hardware with a minimum specification of 64Gb ECC Ram, 2 x 1Tb NVMe RAID1 storage, 8c/16t CPUs and 1Gbit/s bandwidth. Every Validator node has a backup server of the same specification in a different geographical location to the primary. Multiple service providers (currently Hetzner, OVH, and Scaleway) are used to reduce operation risk due to a provider outage.</p>
<p><strong>Experience</strong><br>
My most recent role was System Architect for a Fintech startup (Emerging Markets Bond Exchange) where I was responsible for designing and setting up the production infrastructure. I have also worked as a financial system integrator and worked on a trading floor for 6 years as a front office developer.</p>
<p><strong>Why should delegators stake to your validator?</strong><br>
RadixPool is committed to supporting the Radix Community by building tools, understanding the Radix internals and creating documentation to share our experience and findings. RadixPool sponsors the RadixTalk forum.</p>
