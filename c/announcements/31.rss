            <p>Radix Talk will be shutting down on 23 May 2022.</p>
<p>The forum is currently in Read-Only mode so that the existing content can be archived. I’m hoping to make the content available as static html so that we don’t lose all the valuable contributions made by the community.</p>
<p>I’d like to personally thank <a class="mention" href="https://radixtalk.com/u/mattia">@Mattia</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://radixtalk.com/u/faraz">@Faraz</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://radixtalk.com/u/avaunt">@Avaunt</a> for being moderators on Radix Talk and for all the contributions they have made. Also thank you to everyone who signed up and participated in the forum.</p>
