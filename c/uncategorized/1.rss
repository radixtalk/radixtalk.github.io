            <p>The Radix foundation announced yesterday that they were reducing the number of nodes they operate on the Radix network.  This is great news for the community as it increases the APY for all stakers, whilst providing further decentralisation and opening up 4 new slots for community validators to fill.</p>

<p>Who are the validators youâ€™re looking forward to seeing enter the set?  Is anybody using this as an opportunity to adjust their existing stake?</p>
