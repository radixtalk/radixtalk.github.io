    <title>Radstakes Stands with Ukraine</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/radstakes-stands-with-ukraine/413</link>
    <description>With the conflict intensifying in Ukraine, Radstakes have decided to support our Ukrainian friends by donating all of our 2% fee to support the Ukrainian people for the next 30 days or until Russia withdraw.

At the end of the 30 day period, we will tally up the fees collected, convert to BTC and send this to the Ukraine government&#39;s official crypto donation wallet.

There will be no impact to our stakers&#39; rewards, the only difference will be a temporary change of our node&#39;s name on the network.  Thank you to all our stakers for their continued support.

We invite and welcome any other Radix validators to join us in this initiative over the next 30 days.</description>
