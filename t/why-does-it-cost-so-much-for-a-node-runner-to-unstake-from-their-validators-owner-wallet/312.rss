    <title>Why does it cost so much for a node runner to unstake from their validator&#39;s owner wallet?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/why-does-it-cost-so-much-for-a-node-runner-to-unstake-from-their-validators-owner-wallet/312</link>
    <description>When unstaking from the validator&#39;s owner wallet, the transaction fees can be much higher (up to 45 XRD or more) compared to normal unstaking (0.7 XRD).

## Explanation
The owner wallet generates a large number of substates due to how validator fee distribution is currently done in Alexandria. The more substates involved, the larger the transaction blob, and the higher the fees.</description>
