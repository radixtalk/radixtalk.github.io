    <title>Can I used the Ledger Nano X with the Radix Desktop Wallet?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/can-i-used-the-ledger-nano-x-with-the-radix-desktop-wallet/114</link>
    <description>At the moment you cannot use the Radix app on a Ledger Nano X because the Nano X does not allow unsigned/development versions of the app to be side loaded onto the device. The Nano S does allow this which is why only the Nano S is supported at the moment.

Once the Radix app is &quot;blessed&quot; by Ledger it will be available to install on both the Ledger Nano X and Nano S.</description>
