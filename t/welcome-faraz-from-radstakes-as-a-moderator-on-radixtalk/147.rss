    <description>I’m very happy to announce that @Faraz, who runs the [Radstakes](https://explorer.radixdlt.com/#/validators/rv1qdzgjh98d4mexymc492eq82zwmspmh9mlz4wqgswta4jcaw0nnwuj53mj5w) validator and [Radstakes.com](https://www.radstakes.com/) website, has joined as a moderator on the RadixTalk forum.

Most of us know Faraz from the excellent job he already does moderating the [Radix DLT Discord](https://discord.gg/radixdlt) forum and [Radix DLT Official Telegram](https://t.me/radix_dlt) channel. We are very grateful that he will bring his experience and expertise to the RadixTalk forum.</description>
