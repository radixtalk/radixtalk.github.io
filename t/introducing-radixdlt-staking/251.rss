**Experience**
Our team consists of professional Systems- and Network Engineers with a lot of experience managing and operating mission critical systems professionally. We work hard and relentlessly to optimize our Node&#39;s uptime and hence our Delegator&#39;s rewards. 
We are a proud member of the Radix Validator family since the early Betanet days all the way through Mainnet launch.

**Why should delegators stake to your validator?**
* We distribute XSEED-tokens to all our current and new delegators, which allows them to participate in our Staking Service economic success. So, just stake with us and receive XSEED tokens for free. Find more about the XSEED-token program [here](https://www.radixdltstaking.com/xseed-token/).
* To provide our Delegators with additional incentives and benefits, we are forging partnerships with different Radix projects and Node Runners. Our current partner ships can be found on our website.
* Sustainability and Green IT is very important to us. This was one of our main requirements when we evaluated suitable Datacenter providers in Switzerland. Luckily, we found Datacenters providers, who share our vision of a clean and sustainable IT Infrastructure.</description>
