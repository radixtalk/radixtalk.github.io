    <title>What to do when your validator node can&#39;t connect to the official Radix seed nodes</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/what-to-do-when-your-validator-node-cant-connect-to-the-official-radix-seed-nodes/194</link>
    <description>A new Radix node contacts one or more seed nodes to get a list of other nodes on the network when it starts up. If the node is unable to connect to one of the [official Radix seed nodes](https://radixtalk.com/t/what-are-the-official-radix-seed-node-addresses/195), then the node will stall.

The seed node is specified in the `default.config` file under the `network.p2p.seed_nodes` key

```text
network.p2p.seed_nodes=radix://rn1qvw5v4w8llexz99uc9gmeh47qp2h9ax2y3aewm5e6vj5sdx8uuph2vfuvg3@3.221.232.135
```

It is possible to specify multiple seed nodes by separating them with a comma:
```text
network.p2p.seed_nodes=radix://rn1qvw5v4w8llexz99uc9gmeh47qp2h9ax2y3aewm5e6vj5sdx8uuph2vfuvg3@3.221.232.135,radix://rn1qtq336a2nn2269fjes53pynwlytrv0katm6uzlfcyl6m7yscac5g7mh8prw@3.220.101.80,radix://rn1qwa45jjf40vuf9xlq85xym86yegnm95h3g8d4lul5hskrws9gm6ykyx7hsf@3.214.160.245
```

The good news is that any node on the Radix network can act as a seed node - as long as you know the IP address of the node and node address (rdx1....).

Seed nodes have the following URI format: 

`radix://rn1....@ip.address`

The `rn1...` part is the **Radix Node Address** that is used during the Radix node handshake protocol to created a shared secret for encrypted communication between the two nodes.
