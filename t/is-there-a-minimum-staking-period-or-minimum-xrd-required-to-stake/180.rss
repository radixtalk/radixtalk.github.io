    <title>Is there a minimum staking period or minimum XRD required to stake?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/is-there-a-minimum-staking-period-or-minimum-xrd-required-to-stake/180</link>
    <description>There is no minimum staking period, there is only a 2 weeks delay if you want to unstake your coins, for the network security. Read more about it [here.](https://radixtalk.com/t/why-does-it-take-so-long-to-unstake-from-a-validator/176)
There&#39;s a minimum of 90 XRD for each staking request made from the wallet. 

Don&#39;t forget to leave 0.6 XRD in your wallet to request an unstake.</description>
