**Languages**
* English
* Japanese (Rory)

**About Me/Us**
*The team at Logical Moon are composed of two friends who are based out of Brisbane, Australia. We have been involved in the cryptocurrency scene since 2016 and have followed the Radix Project since December 2017. We both have extensive experience in delivering/maintaining enterprise grade solutions across a variety of industries and have a genuine passion for technology*

**Validator Infrastructure**
*The validator node itself was brought to life in September 2021 and we were able to quickly establish ourselves into the top 100 having been involved in an early investment group for Radix. It currently runs on Azure in the Australia South East Region and we have a backup node constantly running in the Australia East region to ensure high availability. We provide 24/7 support and leverage Azure&#39;s alerting capabilities to escalate any issues to our team. We constantly push to ensure the server is performant/secured and review/update our infrastructure regularly*

**Experience**
*Katan is a Solution Architect and Developer with 20 years of industry experience and his colleague Rory is adept in building cloud based applications and currently helps build and manage a number of applications for an international legal software application firm*

**Why should delegators stake to your validator?**
*We care about the network, the community and ultimately the Radix project as a whole. To achieve a truly decentralised network, it is important to ensure there are enough nodes globally available and with a spread of stake distributed adequately amongst them.  We&#39;ve been initially focused on ensuring we have a stable setup, but as we seem to have found our sweet spot, you&#39;ll see us more actively share content built to help support the radix network*</description>
