    <title>Radix Talk is shutting down</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/radix-talk-is-shutting-down/472</link>
    <description>Radix Talk will be shutting down on 23 May 2022. 

The forum is currently in Read-Only mode so that the existing content can be archived. I&#39;m hoping to make the content available as static html so that we don&#39;t lose all the valuable contributions made by the community.

I&#39;d like to personally thank @Mattia, @Faraz and @Avaunt for being moderators on Radix Talk and for all the contributions they have made. Also thank you to everyone who signed up and participated in the forum.

            <p>Thanks Mattia. I think some of the image links are still pointing at <a href="http://cdn.radixtalk.com">cdn.radixtalk.com</a> which doesn’t exist anymore and are getting redirected to a generic http page.</p>
<p>I’ve rebuilt the forum to use local files instead of the CDN files and will re-do the forum archiving/mirroring to make sure it uses the correct links.</p>
