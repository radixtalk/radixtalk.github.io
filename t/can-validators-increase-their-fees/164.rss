    <title>Can Validators increase their fees?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/can-validators-increase-their-fees/164</link>
    <description>Yes, Validators can increase and decrease their fees at any time, subject to the rules below:

### Fee Increases

* A 500 epoch delay occurs before the fee increase is applied
* Fees may only increase by a maximum absolute increase of 10% at a time (e.g. from 0% to 10%, or 2% to 12%). If a validator wants to increase their fees by more than 10% then they will need to apply the changes over multiple 500 epoch delays.
* The new, higher fee, will be displayed immediately in the Radix Explorer so that existing and potential stakers can see what the new fee will be.

### Fee Decreases

* A fee decrease will take effect at the start of the next epoch
* There is no limit to the decrease (e.g. from 20% to 0%)
