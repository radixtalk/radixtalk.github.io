    <title>Why is Radix unverified/ranked so low on CoinMarketCap?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/why-is-radix-unverified-ranked-so-low-on-coinmarketcap/91</link>
    <description>The Market Cap on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/radix-protocol/) is currently unverified because it requires independent price data from at least 3 different exchanges.

Once XRD is traded on more exchanges then the Market Cap will become **verified** on CoinMarketCap and XRD will be ranked correctly.</description>
