&lt;/div&gt;

&gt;**25 Radix Team Tributjects** in **100 sets** to celebrate the launch of Scrypto!
Collecting at least **1 NFT** entitles you to **recieve ART tokens** and **dividend payments** from the **Artistizen NFT Marketplace** opening in Q2 2022.

**Difference between **collectors** and **traders** NFT:**
&gt;There is no price difference, but as a trader you only keep the place in line, without actually knowing what card you could get.
It&#39;s basically like going to buy a limited pack of pokemon cards but keeping the pack sealed and selling it back later for profit or a trade. You could&#39;ve had a Dan, but you will never know ;)
So a trader just pays 111 XRD for the reservation in line.
As a collector, you will need to pay the rest of the amount to open your pack.

**Price of each NFT**: Price started at 1 XRD and increases by 1 XRD with each reservation placed.
Current price can be seen [here.](https://www.artistizen.com/)
