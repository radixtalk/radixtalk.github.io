&lt;/div&gt;

&gt;Radical Penguins claims the glory of being the first 3D NTF and Penguin collection on Radix. Each of the 10,000 unique Penguins in our colony was crafted with love, care and dedication so that they have their own identity, personality and charm.
Radical in looks, passion and humour, sometimes peculiar, sometimes lovable, and sometimes outright weird, there is a Penguin for everybody!

&gt;Established in January 2022 by two childhood friends that came together to create the next level of NFT art on RADIX. One is a world class designer and founder of a New York based creative agency, the other is a technologist with a deep passion for Radix, based in UK.


**Price of each NFT**: 175 XRD (will increase as supply decreases)
