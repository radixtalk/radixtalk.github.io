**About Me/Us**
Hi, I&#39;m Stuart from RadixPool. We run professionally managed Radix Validators under our own name and for other clients.

Although RadixPool is a relative newcomer to the Radix Community, we were fortunate to be selected to take part in the Radix Betanet and subsequent Stokenet Test network. We have tried to make a small contribution back to the community by creating documentation, scripts, performance optimisations and providing support in the Discord channels.

**Validator Infrastructure**
RadixPool is running 8 servers supporting the Radix Mainnet distributed over 3 countries - Germany, United Kingdom and The Netherlands. Each Radix Node is running on dedicated hardware with a minimum specification of 64Gb ECC Ram, 2 x 1Tb NVMe RAID1 storage, 8c/16t CPUs and 1Gbit/s bandwidth. Every Validator node has a backup server of the same specification in a different geographical location to the primary. Multiple service providers (currently Hetzner, OVH, and Scaleway) are used to reduce operation risk due to a provider outage. 

**Experience**
My most recent role was System Architect for a Fintech startup (Emerging Markets Bond Exchange) where I was responsible for designing and setting up the production infrastructure. I have also worked as a financial system integrator and worked on a trading floor for 6 years as a front office developer.

**Why should delegators stake to your validator?**
RadixPool is committed to supporting the Radix Community by building tools, understanding the Radix internals and creating documentation to share our experience and findings. RadixPool sponsors the RadixTalk forum.</description>
