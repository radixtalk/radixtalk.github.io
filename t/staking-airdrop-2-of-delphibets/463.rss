    <description>üõë **STAKERS PAY ATTENTION!**
After exciting and successful (prediction) events, we want to focus on the stakers again:

üî• **500,000 $DPH will be distributed** üî•

1Ô∏è‚É£ Staking snapshot is taken on 15th of May 2022
2Ô∏è‚É£ The more you stake, the bigger your airdrop
3Ô∏è‚É£ STAKE ON THE DELPHINODE TO RECEIVE 50% AIRDROP BONUS üòç

Stakers of the [DELPHINODE](https://www.radixscan.io/validator/rv1qtj3zvu8ttar6mluw6qzlfu5mnjqpeswcjs07ayalyx4gje4wy4xwq85hhs) have advantages and will receive the [highest bonus](https://t.me/delphibets/12347). The airdrop will follow in the next few days after the snapshot is taken. Starting in May we will introduce a validator fee in line with other Radix nodes of 2.8%.

üíª **How to stake $XRD?**
 For those who want to stake on the DELPHINODE for the first time, Pythia has recorded a video. It was her concern to explain you all in the most simple way, so you can get as many $DPH as possible ‚ù§Ô∏è
