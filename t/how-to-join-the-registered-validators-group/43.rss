    <title>How to join the Registered Validators group</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/how-to-join-the-registered-validators-group/43</link>
    <description>Node runners who are running registered validator nodes (even if they are not in the Top 100) can request to join the **Registered Validator** group here: https://radixtalk.com/g/registered_validator

Benefits of joining the **Registered Validator** group:

* Create a post in the **Validator Introductions** category to introduce and promote your node to delegators
* Create additional posts to announce promotions, news, updates, etc. for your Validator
* Access to the private **Validator Chat** category
* A title of **Registered Validator** added to your profile
* Registered Validator flair added to your avatar
* The ability to promote your Validator Node for free with a small banner ad on RadixTalk.com (see: https://radixtalk.com/t/promote-your-validator-node-for-free-on-radix-talk/69?u=stuart)

You will need to provide the Radix Validator Address (rv1...) of any nodes you run and may have to wait a short time while your membership request is reviewed.</description>
