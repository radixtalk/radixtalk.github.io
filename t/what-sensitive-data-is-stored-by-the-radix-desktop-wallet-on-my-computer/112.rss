    <title>What sensitive data is stored by the Radix Desktop Wallet on my computer?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/what-sensitive-data-is-stored-by-the-radix-desktop-wallet-on-my-computer/112</link>
    <description>The Radix Desktop Wallet creates a `wallet.json` file that contains the encrypted parameters used to derive your wallet private keys and addresses.

The most sensitive value in the wallet.json file is the `ciphertext` value which is the AES-256-GCM encrypted value of the `entropy` that determines your seed phrase. The safety of this ciphertext value is dependent on:

1. The strength of the password/passphrase that you use to unlock the Radix Desktop Wallet
2. The strength/security of the AES-256-GCM cipher

For a detailed analysis of how the wallet.json works, see:
