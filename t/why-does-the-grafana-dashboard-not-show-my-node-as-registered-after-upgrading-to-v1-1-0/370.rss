    <title>Why does the Grafana dashboard not show my node as registered after upgrading to v1.1.0?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/why-does-the-grafana-dashboard-not-show-my-node-as-registered-after-upgrading-to-v1-1-0/370</link>
    <description>The official Radix docs for installing the node software includes instructions for setting up Grafana locally to visualise the Prometheus metrics: [Installing Grafana Dashboard](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/node-and-gateway/install-grafana-dashboard.html)

The panel which shows &quot;Registered Validator&quot; reads a metric from the node info called **validator_registered**.  Unfortunately this metric no longer exists in v1.1.0 so if you are setting up a Grafana dashboard after upgrading to this node version, the panel will incorrectly state &quot;No&quot; even if your node is correctly registered.

The Radix team have acknowledged this and will be updating the Grafana dashboard in a future update.  In the meantime, you can edit the panel and change the metric to **nodeinfo{is_in_validator_set=&quot;true&quot;}**</description>
