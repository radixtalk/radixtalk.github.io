    <title>How to get started in Scrypto</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/how-to-get-started-in-scrypto/283</link>
    <description>A lot of developers are asking about how to get started in Scrypto. On this post, I am giving guidelines to help you become the Scrypto expert you want to become.

## Should I know Rust before starting ?
This is a question we get a lot. Knowing the basics of Rust&#39;s syntax will make it easier for you to understand and write Scrypto code, but you don&#39;t need to be an expert in Rust. We suggest people new to Rust to read [A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust). This quick tutorial will teach just about anyone with a little programming experience enough of the Rust basics to start building with Scrypto quickly.

## From zero to expert
1. Read the [Scrypto documentation](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/introduction.html) and try the concepts you learn in the [Scrypto Playground](https://play.scrypto-lang.org/)
2. Install Rust and the Scrypto simulator by following [these instructions](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/install-scrypto.html)
3. Look at Scrypto examples in the [community-scrypto](https://github.com/radixdlt/community-scrypto-examples) GitHub repository
4. Make your own example and create a pull request to that same repository. This will allow you to get feedback from RDX Works
5. Participate in the discussions on the Scrypto [Discord](https://discord.gg/tfw6vhY32n) and [Telegram](t.me/RadixDevelopers) channels

After that, it&#39;s only a matter of coding, coding, and more coding. After writing a couple of examples, you will become good enough in Scrypto to make your own project and help people in the community !</description>
