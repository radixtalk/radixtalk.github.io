    <description>Dear All,
The long awaited announcement is here:

Announcing the ü™êRadixPlanet Validator Node, now up and running with 0% fee promo for two months

Our node offers the following features and benefits:

‚úÖ PLANET airdrop rewards to stakers until we achieve 2% of total network stake

‚úÖ Early staking IS beneficial, the earlier you stake the larger amount of PLANET rewards you get

‚úÖ Rewards are proportional to the staked amount, The larger amount you stake, the larger amount of PLANET rewards you get

‚úÖ Monthly rewards distribution of PLANET tokens to ALL stakers

‚úÖ Validator fee is set to rise from 0% to a reasonable 2.5% after two months to help support and develop the RadixPlanet exchange

‚úÖ The ONLY case the validator fee is expected to be raised above 2.5% is if the node exceeds 3% of total network stake, where an increase in fee will be used to deter further staking and improve decentralization.
