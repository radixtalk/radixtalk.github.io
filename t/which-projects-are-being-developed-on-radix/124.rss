    <title>Which projects are being developed on Radix?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/which-projects-are-being-developed-on-radix/124</link>
    <description>The amount of projects on Radix grows rapidly. A good place to start exploring these projects, is [Radix List](https://www.radixlist.com/). It attempts to collect and categorize all projects on Radix.

Some noteworthy projects are:
* **OciSwap**, a decentralized exchange which is scheduled to launch on day 1 of [Babylon](https://radixtalk.com/t/what-is-the-radix-roadmap/123). Similarly, DefiPlaza and CERBY will also be launching DEX initiatives on Radix.
* **Doge³**, the first memecoin on Radix, which will be listed on VinDAX as of 7 January, 2022. There are plenty other memecoins as well, such as Samusky and DIX.
* **CerbyMask**, a browser wallet
* **Nerds Republic**, the first NFT project. Other NFT projects include Abandoned Scorpions and HOARD.</description>
