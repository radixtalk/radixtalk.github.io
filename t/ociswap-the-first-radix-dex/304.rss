**Ociswap is the first pairwise DEX that will be launched at the Radix Babylon release.**

The combination of low fees on the Radix network, and the masterminds behind Ociswap, makes this project very promising.

The intention is to create a decentralized exchange, where people could easily swap one token for another token, without the use of a third party, directly from their wallets.

&amp;#8212;

**#ROADMAP**

Our main goal is to become the default DEX on Radix. We have some potential long term features like futures, order books, limit orders and stuff like that. However, this will probably rather be a separate section, because we want to keep the main interface simple and clean.

In general, we are currently exploring different options regarding reducing impermanent loss, on-ledger multi pool routing or token mechanics and incentives. But Babylon is roughly a year away and a lot depends on the Babylon fee model which isn&#39;t announced yet (because Babylon isn&#39;t implemented yet).

Also we are exploring protocol owned liquidity. The reward mechanism is different, instead of staking LP tokens the protocol is buying the LP tokens at a premium (giving LP providers a discount). 

The advantage is that the protocol then owns the liquidity, because with basic liquidity mining you often have the problem that people farm the rewards, dump them and then remove their liquidity afterwards.
However, in both cases people start by adding tokens to the pool. Only the second step regarding rewards is different.

DeFi is moving fast and a year is a long time to commit to a specific feature set (not even talking about long term roadmap 2 years away).

Babylon is coming late 2022 probably. So we are just very early and now is the time for experimentation and exploring the capabilities of Scrypto.

We are thinking for a dApp user on Radix there are multiple implicit advantages: 
Smart contracts and tokens are much more safe, fees are cheap, transactions are fast without any scalability issue and finality is low. üî•

So far so good, what we are thinking will be a really cool feature for users which developers can use is atomic composability from the frontend. Your dApp can compose ad-hoc different transactions together and even your wallet could do it if the dApp doesn&#39;t support it. 

This opens the path to countless opportunities, so you could take out a flash loan to arbitrage a pool - all from your dApp - no smart contracts needed. 

In general Ociswap will be a pair wise DEX with a mechanism to incentive liquidity providing. However, a lot can happen until Babylon and we can&#39;t commit a year in advance to a certain mechanism like liquidity mining. The general tokenomics don&#39;t change, 60% will be used for liquidity rewards some way or another)!

&amp;#8212;

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Ociswap ($OCI) Tokenomics:**

16 million (16%) Team/Marketing/Development

24 million (24%) Airdrops

60 million (60%) Liquidity Mining Rewards

&amp;#8212;

‚òÅ **AIRDROPS** üíß

Thank you very much for all of your support since we started Ociswap. You are an amazing community üî•

ü§ü The details about the upcoming airdrops and community events are here!

24,000,000 $OCI are waiting for you! üêà

We have made the conscious decision not to do a pre-sale but to support the community as much as possible with cool events and airdrops!

**To register for the airdrops either:**

1. Tell your wallet address to our [@ocicatbot](https://t.me/ocicatbot) over Telegram

**OR**

2. Send the message #OciStaker to this Radix wallet rdx1qspwv9l3ls4lxwkrqrrvtwdskg2hjue0ywpfqlxvj5pzpalvlext5hq5fl2u6

(the second option will only count for staking airdrops ‚Äº [@ocicatbot](https://t.me/ocicatbot) is required for all upcoming community airdrops)
