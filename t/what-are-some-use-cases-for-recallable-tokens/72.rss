    <title>What are some use cases for RECALLABLE tokens?</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/what-are-some-use-cases-for-recallable-tokens/72</link>
    <description>Some example use cases:
- Subscription system: where you pay a monthly fee to be subscribed to a service. The owner of the service must be able to withdraw your right to use it (if you don&#39;t pay for example).
- Badges that indicate AML/KYC: The issuer must be able to take it back if the user no longer meet the requirements
- NFTs that indicate ownership of in-game assets: the game must be able to remove the NFT in you inventory if you lose that item
