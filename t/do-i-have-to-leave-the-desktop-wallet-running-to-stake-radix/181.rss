    <title>Do I have to leave the desktop wallet running to stake Radix?</title>

    <description>No, there&#39;s no need to leave your wallet open for staking to happen! 
Radix uses a **DPoS** (***D**elegated **P**roof **o**f **S**take*) system to reach consensus, which is different compared to a **PoW** (***P**roof **o**f **W**ork*) system like Bitcoin.
Your stake is being handled by the validator node you delegated it to.

You can obviously also turn off your computer.</description>
