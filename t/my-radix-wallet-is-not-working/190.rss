    <title>My Radix Wallet is not working</title>
    <link>https://radixtalk.com/t/my-radix-wallet-is-not-working/190</link>
    <description>## Wallet Version
Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Radix Wallet available from: 
https://wallet.radixdlt.com/

Older versions of the wallet (v1.0.x) do not work with the current archive nodes.

## Issues with Official Archive Nodes
Your wallet may be having problems connecting to the official Radix Archive nodes. RadixDLT run several load balanced, regional archive nodes (Ireland, India, Australia and the United States).

1. If the problem is localised to a region, then using a VPN to connect to a different region may resolve the issue.

2. You can connect  the wallet to a Community Archive node by following the instructions here:

  <blockquote>
    Some Validators run public, community archive nodes that may be useful when there is a lot of demand on the official Radix Archive Nodes: 
Risk Warning - whilst the archive nodes listed below are run by known, long serving community members, please be advised that they are not official Radix nodes and so do require a certain amount of trust.  There is an element of risk in the unlikely event that a community archive node runner acted maliciously.
