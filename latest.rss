            <p>Radix Talk will be shutting down on 23 May 2022.</p>
<p>The forum is currently in Read-Only mode so that the existing content can be archived. I’m hoping to make the content available as static html so that we don’t lose all the valuable contributions made by the community.</p>
<p>I’d like to personally thank <a class="mention" href="https://radixtalk.com/u/mattia">@Mattia</a>, <a class="mention" href="https://radixtalk.com/u/faraz">@Faraz</a> and <a class="mention" href="https://radixtalk.com/u/avaunt">@Avaunt</a> for being moderators on Radix Talk and for all the contributions they have made. Also thank you to everyone who signed up and participated in the forum.</p>

            <p>I just learned Radixtalk is shutting down. Sorry to hear that, though I can understand it doesn’t make much sense for you to keep it alive.</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thanks for all the effort you have been putting into getting momentum going and providing such resources for the community.</p>

          <title>How do I get Gateway API data into Grafana Cloud</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Faraz | Radstakes.com]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Validators</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>When it comes to adding metrics into Grafana, Radix have provided the metrics end point which provides a certain amount of data from the node in Prometheus format which can then be visualised by Grafana.</p>
<p>However, there may be other metrics that node runners desire that are not currently present in the core API, but may be present in the Gateway.  This post explains how to import REST API data directly into Grafana.  For this example we will use Validator Total Stake (this is currently not available in the Core API, but can be requested through the Gateway).</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the Infinity data source by selecting configuration–&gt;data sources–&gt;add data source–&gt;find more data source plugins on grafana<br>

            <p>Following the recent release of node software v1.1.1, the team have advised on a number of further releases which are planned over the next new months to implement coordinated forking.  This will initiate a fork to an updated protocol, only when a certain threshold of validators (or stake weight) have upgraded.  Validators who have not updated by a prescribed time, will be removed from the validator set until they do so.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an update for Validator Liveness Assurance is planned in June which will temporarily remove validators from the set if they don’t meet the required liveness standards.  See details below (source: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/417762285172555786/883338066524274695/966728048047185950">Radix Discord</a>)</p>
<p><img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_right.png?v=12" title=":arrow_right:" class="emoji" alt=":arrow_right:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Node version 1.1.1 released 22nd April 2022. It’s a recommended reliability upgrade, and should be an easy upgrade from 1.1.0 - more details here: <a href="https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/releases/tag/1.1.1">https://github.com/radixdlt/radixdlt/releases/tag/1.1.1</a></p>
<p><img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_right.png?v=12" title=":arrow_right:" class="emoji" alt=":arrow_right:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">  1.2.0 - Support for co-ordinated forking [Releases early May]</p>
<p>This release will enable nodes to recognise fork votes. We’re hoping to have documentation, a new CLI version, and a release candidate available for testing some time next week. As part of preparing for this release, we will run through the process of a hard fork on Stokenet, and we’ll ask for node runners’ assistance with testing this. This will hopefully ready for stokenet testing in the middle of next week.</p>
<p><img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_right.png?v=12" title=":arrow_right:" class="emoji" alt=":arrow_right:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> 1.3.0 - The first candidate fork [Likely releases around mid-May, with fork hopefully enacting around the end of May]</p>
<p>This will capture updates to the fee table. Node runners will need to install the new version of the software, and validators will be taken through the process to vote for the fork. There will be a grace period between the version being released and the fork being able to enact. When the fork is enacted, nodes running old versions of the software will be unable to continue syncing past the fork point.</p>
<p><img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/arrow_right.png?v=12" title=":arrow_right:" class="emoji" alt=":arrow_right:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> 1.4.0 -  Validator Liveness Assurance [Potentially releases early June, with fork enacting soon after a few weeks later]</p>
<p>Our second candidate fork. This update will “jail” validators who don’t meet sufficient liveness guarantees, ensuring validators who crash or fail to meet reasonable liveness standards will be temporarily removed from the validator set, ensuring the network stays running smoothly. More details will follow in due course.</p>

<p>*<strong>Staking</strong> may be started by transferring XRD from an account to a <code>prepared_stake</code> entity with a specific validator. Once XRD is in this entity, at some point the system will move this XRD to a Validator entity and mint StakeUnits into the originating account.</p>
<p>*<strong>Unstaking</strong> may be started by transfering StakeUnits from an account to a <code>prepared_unstake</code> entity. Once StakeUnits is in this entity, at some point the system will destroy this StakeUnits and transfer XRD from the Validator entity into your <code>exiting_stake</code> entity. Once the unlocking period is over the system will move that XRD from the <code>exiting_stake</code> entity into your account.</p>
<p>I’m trying to figure out how to construct the call, but hitting a roadblock.<br>

          <title>Raduel | Radix MMORPG</title>

            <p><strong>Raduel</strong></p>
<p>A 2D pixel MMORPG that attempts to let the player do anything they want whilst giving them ownership of their assets within game.</p>
<p>Players will be able to do anything they want in game: Follow the various storylines and paths, missions, PvE, PvP, skilling and training up skills, crafting, traversing across universes, guilds, and so much more.</p>
<p>One of the first aspects of our MMORPG will be to have a small world you can run around in, and challenge other players to battles with your mini-pets. The first mini-pet within Raduel is our “GOLEMZ”… these are giant golem-like pets that have unique weapons and traits.</p>
<p><strong>Mini-Pet Battles</strong></p>
<p>Within the MMORPG will be a “mini-game” where players can walk up to each other and challenge the other person to a battle using their mini-pets. Similar to how Pokémon would allow for battles.</p>
<p>Upon a challenge request, a pop-up comes up allowing the users to select their mini-pets, and how many mini-pets are to be used in the battle i.e. each player has 3 mini-pets to use.</p>
<p>Within the battle, players take it in turns to strike the other players mini-pet. The last one standing wins.</p>
<p>Mini-pets have levels that can be increased through winning battles. If a mini-pet gets traded to another player the levels are reset. Damage and defence levels have a “base” and then takes a multiplier from their level.</p>
<p>Golemz will have a special attack for their weapons.</p>

<p><strong>RULE</strong></p>
<p>RULE is the in-game currency that can be used to purchase things in game. Our MMORPG will not be pay to win. If there is an item in-game that can be used to do things such as kill other players (swords, guns, laser rifles, etc) then it can be purchased with either in-game gold or RULE!</p>
<p>We also plan to give RULE holders a percentage of the earnings that the game makes back to those holders.</p>

<p><strong>DELPHIBETS is the first prediction market protocol exclusively on Radix DLT</strong> <img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/crystal_ball.png?v=12" title=":crystal_ball:" class="emoji" alt=":crystal_ball:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/fire.png?v=12" title=":fire:" class="emoji" alt=":fire:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>With the launch of Babylon, DELPHIBETS will provide an intuitive prediction interface. You will then have the opportunity to bet on future events and compete with opposing bettors. While we, as an intermediary, ensure the safe payout of successful bets and the correct distribution of wagers, you can multiply your stakes, climb the leaderboard and earn privileges. More detailed information will be available soon.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Team</strong></p>
<p>Our team has 10+ years of experience in software development, marketing and digital communication. With DELPHIBETS, we have combined and channeled our previous experience to provide excellence in development &amp; growth.</p>
<p><em>Involved are</em>:<br>
Martin Müller, Rakaunaut, Felix, Chris, Jeremy, Jonas (Radix German), Marco (Ociswap) &amp; Florian (Florian Pieper Staking &amp; Ociswap).</p>
<p><strong>2.) Tokenomics</strong></p>

<p>$DPH is the native token of DELPHIBETS with a total supply of 99,999,999 $DPH. Our token will play a leading role on our platform. With the launch of Babylon, you will be able to use our Token $DPH for the future bets of your choice. Further, we reward your participation, commitment and dedication. You will be able to stake $DPH with us, get involved in validating bets or participate in decision making.</p>
<p><strong>3.) How do I get §DPH?</strong></p>
<p>Currently it is not possible to trade $DPH. At the moment our Staking and Comunity Airdrop are the only opportunities to get $DPH. At a later date, we also plan to have a very limited presale.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Stakers of our partner nodes and those of the top 100 validators regularly receive airdrops of our token. But only the stakers of the DELPHINODE get a special bonus that doubles the amount of $DPH you receive (until 1% validator stake, afterwards you will still receive a 50% bonus).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During our community events we reward your active participation with $DPH airdrops. Stakers, especially those of the DELPHINODE, might have a special advantage here as well.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4.)</strong> <strong>Staking on the</strong> "<img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/classical_building.png?v=12" title=":classical_building:" class="emoji" alt=":classical_building:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> <strong>DELPHINODE"</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/warning.png?v=12" title=":warning:" class="emoji" alt=":warning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> We are reaching the 1% validator stake on the <a href="https://www.radixscan.io/validator/rv1qtj3zvu8ttar6mluw6qzlfu5mnjqpeswcjs07ayalyx4gje4wy4xwq85hhs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DELPHINODE</a> very soon. To receive the bonus in the future and double your amount of $DPH by staking you should hurry up.</p>

<hr>
<p>Lots to say!</p>
<p>Firstly - why aren’t all the NFT projects in this list?</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a lot more projects since I last made this list, with different sales structures, making this task nearly impossible to do for all with any consistency.</li>
<li>Some projects haven’t really made a stamp on the community, with few sales and personally, I view this as to do with the poor quality of their websites or overall, they’ve shown low-effort.</li>
<li>I may have missed them.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a project is missing from the list - happy to be challenged on it - and also feel free to make your own.</p>
<p><strong>Some nuances and comments:</strong></p>
<p>Abandoned Scorps is without question the most successful NFT collection on Radix. However, the floor price used here at 400 XRD is recent (and somewhat self-pronounced) and yet to see volume at that level. That said, a lot of Scorps are going at prices well above this - regularly seeing editions going for 1000+ XRD.</p>
<p>Radical Penguins has shot high up on the list to now brush elbows with some of the first projects to launch on Radix - a clap of the flippers to them for this. As a purely NFT based project, they arguably could be considered to be ahead of Scrypto Punks and Nerds Republic - both of which hold the promise of ‘more’. Notably, Penguins allege to have raised over £2 million in charity donations for one penguin, so there’s an argument to be made that they’ve blown all projects out the water.</p>
<p>This leads me to ask, why aren’t all the penguins sold out? Maybe there’s not enough liquidity in the Radix community, maybe people are waiting to see the collection, maybe some people don’t really believe the big donation happened, or perhaps, it just hasn’t dawned on some that a big investor has their eyes on this project and what that might mean.</p>
<p>Radix Collection has been through the rounds of their NFT drops since my last post, raising over 500,000 XRD. Interestingly the collection and the accompanying site seems to be trying to push the Olympia net to its limits with a proto-market place and other features, such as badges. I’m curious why the project hasn’t done better - it has all the things people would usually call for, lots of features, proven delivery, a doxxed developer and a clearly capable team committed to the project. But I don’t think I’m alone in thinking there’s something that just doesn’t quite ‘tickle my fancy’ (British slang for something that’s not desirable)… it could be the artworks themselves and potentially even the sales structure, but that’s my potentially just my personal view. With a pivot to more mature and consistent visuals, I think a lot more traction could be brought to their valuable offering.</p>
<p>However, Radix Collection isn’t the only project with a strong developer core making moves - Artizen and the Raddish Wallet (renamed recently to RadBags) are dipping their toes into the NFT space too. Artizen taking a more retro/pixel approach with Skullzo and Techzillas on their new proto-market place and Radish going for a cute and cuddly look. Artizen have been smart to somewhat ‘artificially’ constrain supply, releasing in small batches creating an early experience of trading for participants. In terms of user experience, I’d rate it as superior to RC’s current platform which feels more disjointed. In my view, Artizen may be taking an early step to be crowned ‘The’ Radix NFT market place - which would be fitting as the creators of the first Radix NFT. Whoever truly wants to win the crown of the Radix NFT marketplace - Radix Collection, Artizen, Scrypto Punks, Oci, Cerby, or others - my only question is… who will pay Korone the most to list Abandoned Scorpions?</p>
<p><strong>Some honourable mentions:</strong></p>
<p>Natty Radishes made some great improvements to their website with the help of Scrypto apprentice Omar.</p>
<p>Root Materials distributed their token and holders appear to value their editions as more than a flip, with owners using their NFTs for their own endeavours.</p>
<p>Radical Robos seems like a fun NFT series and I appreciate that the artist creates additional content using their style, showing some versatility moving forward.</p>
<p>—------</p>
<p>April is lining up to be a packed schedule for NFTs and developments on Radix. I have some more thoughts on these I’d love to share and will make another post about my thoughts on what’s up and coming over the weekend.</p>

          <title>Validator Node Software Update Best Practices/Process?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Zero Point Three]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Validators</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello all…</p>
<p>In preparation for the eventual upgrade of node software, I was wondering if you guys help could verify the high-level steps of an validator node software update process, or point out what may be unnecessary, missing, or just plain wrong.</p>
<p>The way i see it, one can upgrade the software within the same server… or one can use a backup server to aid in the switch to the upgrade version.  What are the pros and cons to each option?  I am thinking that using a backup is superior because it allows roll-back to the primary if something goes wrong in the software upgrade process.</p>
<p>Also, should the validators always be un-registered and re-registered within this software upgrade process? I am thinking if they are not, proposals will be missed if a validator is stopped/restarted while it is still registered, so un-register should always be done before stop/restart and re-register after the stop/restart, correct? (assuming all is working as expected)  This would introduce a small period of time when the validator is not generating rewards, but that should be a relatively short amount of time, correct?  Or is there a way to do this without any downtime at all? (without risk of missed proposals)</p>

Any feedback for refinement is welcome <img src="https://radixtalk.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">
</h2>
<p><strong>Same/single server</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Unregister node as validator</li>
<li>Wait until the current epoch ends</li>
<li>Stop the node</li>
<li>Upgrade the node software</li>
<li>Start the node</li>
<li>Ensure node is up without error and is syncing correctly. Wait until sync’d.</li>
<li>Register node as validator again</li>
<li>Ensure validator is processing proposals without issues</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Using backup server</strong></p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Step 0… pre-requisite step:   Ensure a backup server is already running as a non-validator node using a non-validator keystore (to ensure it is always in sync, and no lengthy catch-up sync times are ever needed)</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER: Stop the node</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER: Upgrade the node software</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER: Start the node</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER: Ensure node is up without error and is syncing correctly. Wait until sync’d.</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER: Move the validator keystore into the secrets directory in preparation for node restart as validator</li>
<li>PRIMARY SERVER: Unregister node as validator</li>
<li>PRIMARY SERVER: Wait until the current epoch ends</li>
<li>PRIMARY SERVER: Stop the node</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER: Restart the backup node, which now has validator keystore and is as sync’d up as possible</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER: Ensure node is up without error, is syncing correctly. Wait until sync’d. BACKUP SERVER is now the new primary validator node server. Old primary server is now a backup.</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER (now new PRIMARY): Register node as validator again</li>
<li>BACKUP SERVER (now new PRIMARY): Ensure validator is processing proposals without issues</li>
<li>PRIMARY SERVER (now new BACKUP): Switch to non-validator keystore, upgrade software, start node, and ensure it is up and syncing without error. PRIMARY is now the new BACKUP that is syncing continuously in case a failover from PRIMARY is ever needed.</li>
</ol>

            <p>With the conflict intensifying in Ukraine, Radstakes have decided to support our Ukrainian friends by donating all of our 2% fee to support the Ukrainian people for the next 30 days or until Russia withdraw.</p>
<p>At the end of the 30 day period, we will tally up the fees collected, convert to BTC and send this to the Ukraine government’s official crypto donation wallet.</p>
<p>There will be no impact to our stakers’ rewards, the only difference will be a temporary change of our node’s name on the network.  Thank you to all our stakers for their continued support.</p>
<p>We invite and welcome any other Radix validators to join us in this initiative over the next 30 days.</p>

            <p>Once again RadixDLT Staking and Radical Staking have great news for the Radix community:</p>
<p>Staatenlos Node has joined our alliance to maximize 100% uptime and rewards for our delegators and now all three of us will support each other’s validator nodes in the very unlikely event of unprecedented situations where one of our nodes goes down and our respective teams are not able to bring it back up.</p>
<p>This will provide yet another layer of security, reliability and resiliency on top of the existing measures that we already have in place for our productive nodes individually, such as multiple fully-synced server backups, multiple database backups, and team members that help provide 24x7x365 on-call support for node issues. With the added expertise and experience of the Staatenlos team-who are the co-founders of Ociswap, there are three Node Runner now supporting each other in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>All delegators of RadixDLT Staking, RadicalStaking and Staatenlos Node can rest easy, knowing that their delegated XRD is in good hands.</p>
<p>Find out more about Staatenlos Node, check out their <a href="https://staatenlos.ch/staatenlos/radix-staatenlos-node/">website</a> and <a href="https://t.me/radix_staatenlos">Telegram</a>, which supports both German and English speakers.</p>
<p>As always, we recommend spreading your XRD stakes across multiple delegators, including validator nodes in the bottom 50% to promote the security and decentralisation of the Radix network.</p>
